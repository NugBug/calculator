# Calculator

This basic calculator was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Installation

Just download the files and launch in your browser locally. Alternatively you can access this through the linked GitHub Pages link.

## Usage and Notes

This is still a work in progress. The calculator output will flow over when at a length of about 20 characters. The
% and +/- buttons still do not work and may cause the calculator to crash or output unexpected results.

## License

Not necessary but if it is:
